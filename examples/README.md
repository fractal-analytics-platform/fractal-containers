The main supported example in this folder is the `full-stack` one.

The following other examples are available, but they are updates less frequently (please open an issue if you need a more recent version):
* `submission-stress-test`: environment to stress-test Fractal job submission and SLURM execution
* `slurm-stress-test-rpcs`: environment to stress-test SLURM job execution
* `ssh-based`: environment to run Fractal as in an SSH-based deployment, where fractal-server does not have direct access to SLURM.

`slurm-common` is an auxiliary folder, with code shared by different examples.
